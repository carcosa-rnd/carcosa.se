## Our Story

Zenith Group was founded by Tommy Jacobson and Sune Nilsson in 2018. The story goes back to the 90s when the duo founded Trevise Bank, which was later divested. A few years later, in 2000, the duo started Quesada Asset Management which soon gave rise to the investment company Varenne AB, which became the group’s parent company.

Varennes’ first investment was Unibet, which generated 11x the money and 46% annual return. Since then, Varenne has successfully invested mainly in start-up companies and growth companies as well as real estate funds based on its diversified and opportunistic investment strategy.

In order to further exploit the opportunities in start-up companies, Zenith Venture Capital AB was founded in late 2015 focusing only on early stage companies.

The formation of Zenith Group became the next natural step in the development to clarify the offer to the market and to create an efficient organization. Zenith Group focuses on investments in start-up companies and growth companies.

Zenith’s funds are listed on the regulated trading site NDX and Zenith Group is thus the first in Sweden to offer access to unlisted companies at early stages for all types of investors.



## Our Ambition / Vision / Mission
Our dream is to make fantastic investments in brilliant people and
their businesses, and that we will be fortunate enough to carry on doing
what we do together for a long time.

### We want to build something that lasts
Whether it be saving newborns from asphyxia or improving offerings to merchants, we want to be able to look ourselves in the mirror and say we do good.

### We try to build respectful relationships
We build our business on mutually respectful relationships with our fellow investment partners, our investee companies and their management teams.

### We want to have fun and enjoy the work we carry out
We want to laugh our brains out and go ice skating at Hellasgården every now and then. We do not let this prevent us from striving to be world class professionals and performers.

We are humble and grateful for having been handed the opportunity to do what we do. We love what we do and we hope it shows.
