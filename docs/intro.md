# About Us

We are an operative co-founder of IT-companies with international growth ambitions. Our primary investment resources are time and knowledge to solve common biz and tech problems.

Carcosa R&D is the front of a cooperation between Daniel Lindh, Martin Palmer and our different teams.
We have worked together since 1997 when we had our first software development job at the same company.
